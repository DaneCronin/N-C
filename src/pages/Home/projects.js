    challenge: `Cliffhanger is a tribute to the interplay between light and
                form. During a time when the world seemed paused, we set out to
                create a piece that celebrates movement, space, and emotion.
                Through thoughtful creative direction and intricate
                post-production, we crafted a narrative that feels both intimate
                and expansive—a beacon for those searching for connection and
                inspiration in uncertain times.`,
    challengeDesc: `Cliffhanger explores the idea of finding clarity in moments of
                obscurity. Inspired by the duality of light and shadow, we
                imagined a character who navigates a surreal world, guided by
                beams of light that reveal hidden paths and truths. This
                character, free from physical constraints, embodies the
                liberation from everyday burdens, moving fluidly through spaces
                that are both familiar and otherworldly.`,
    creativeSolution: `To bring Cliffhanger to life, we focused on creating a
                seamless blend of reality and surrealism. Escapism became our
                guiding principle, leading us to juxtapose real-life moments
                with ethereal 3D landscapes. Shot on the quiet streets of
                Saigon, our Director of Photography, Ray Lavers, captured
                fleeting glimpses of reality in just two hours during
                quarantine. These grounded visuals set the stage for the
                dreamlike sequences that followed.`,
