    brief: `ABUS, a brand known for world-class bike locks, turned to us to launch their Cliffhanger helmet and break into the competitive protection market. By showcasing the helmet in the rugged Utah desert—on massive ridgelines, jumps, and exposed freeride terrain—we positioned it as a serious contender for seasoned riders, going toe-to-toe with the industry's best.`,
    challengeDesc: `ABUS, a company renowned for its top-tier bike locks, sought to expand its footprint into the helmet and protection market. With their strong reputation among cyclists, they needed a bold launch for the Cliffhanger helmet—a product aimed at solidifying their place in a highly competitive market.
While ABUS had created content targeting new riders, they wanted to position the Cliffhanger as a helmet that could go head-to-head with the industry’s leading protection brands. The challenge? Capturing the attention of seasoned riders who demand both style and performance in the most dangerous conditions.
`,
    creativeSolution: `To introduce the Cliffhanger, we chose the freeride mecca of the Utah desert. This iconic desert terrain, known for its unforgiving ridgelines and massive jumps, provided the perfect backdrop to showcase the helmet’s capabilities. The high-risk environment underscored the Cliffhanger’s durability, design, and ability to perform under extreme conditions.
We tailored the visuals and narrative for riders who live and breathe the sport—those who push limits and value gear they can trust. By featuring dramatic ridge lines, big exposure, and jaw-dropping jumps, we aligned the Cliffhanger with the kind of energy and credibility that seasoned riders expect from top-tier protection brands.
The result? The ABUS Cliffhanger launched not as an accessory, but as a direct competitor to the best helmets in the segment— earning its place on the heads of riders who demand the most from their gear.

    brief: `Verb Coffee Roasters, one of Boulder’s most celebrated cafes, needed an online presence that matched the vibrancy and expertise of their in-shop experience. We crafted a website that brought their passion for coffee education to life, while engaging customers with features that mirrored the journey they offered in-store.`,
    challengeDesc: `Verb Coffee Roasters had perfected the cafe experience, with baristas educating customers about the origins, varietals, and nuances and terroir of their coffee. While their cafe was one of Boulder’s best, their online presence didn’t reflect the same level of expertise, beauty, or customer engagement. They needed a website that showcased their story, elevated their e-commerce game, and connected with customers on a deeper level.`,
    creativeSolution: `We immersed ourselves in Verb’s in-store process, studying how they educated customers and brought each coffee to life. From this, we created "Talk Coffee With Me," a dynamic section on every product page that provided detailed insights into each coffee—its origin, flavor notes, elevation, and why it’s special.
To spark excitement for the launch, we introduced a treasure hunt, hiding a year-long coffee subscription within the 404 error page. Reward the customers that took our advice to “get lost” to find this one. This playful element encouraged customers to explore the site, mirroring the curiosity and discovery that Verb cultivates in-store with having 5-7 different you can try at any moment. The result was a website that didn’t just sell coffee but captured the essence of Verb’s café ethos, delivering an experience as rich as their coffees...`,

    brief: `Create stunning imagery documenting the mid-century modern project "Taliesin West" by legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright`,
    challengeDesc: ` Photographing Taliesin West requires mastering the interplay of light and shadow, as the harsh desert lighting can obscure details or overpower the design’s subtle textures. Thoughtful compositions must balance the building's geometric complexity with its seamless integration into the surrounding landscape, emphasizing Wright's philosophy of organic architecture. Capturing transitions between interior and exterior spaces, along with the harmony of materials and nature, ensures the imagery reflects the timeless essence of this mid-century modern masterpiece.`,
    creativeSolution: `Leveraging years of experience and a deep understanding of working with natural light helps to highlight Taliesin West’s textures and the interplay with the desert landscape. Addressing these challenges thoughtfully ensures imagery that reflects both the architectural beauty of Taliesin West and the innovative spirit of Frank Lloyd Wright’s mid-century modern vision.`,

    brief: "When filmmakers Joey Schusler, Thomas Woodson, and Ben Page pitched the idea of a film blending mountain biking, Italian culture, and the search for the perfect espresso, the answer was an immediate yes. Café Americano would be a film that blurred the line between a short film and an action-packed edit, celebrating the joy of riding and the culture surrounding it.",
    challengeDesc: `The trip was already a logistical feat, with plans to travel from Rome to the Dolomites, capturing moments that ranged from urban riding in Cinque Terre to epic freeride descents. But just two weeks before departure, Shawn Neer—the rider and focal point of the film—fractured his T9 and T10 vertebrae. With tickets bought, an Alfa Romeo reserved, and the crew ready to roll, Shawn made the call to push through his injury, relying on his experience as a professional athlete to navigate his limits and keep the project on track.`,
    creativeSolution: `The journey began in Rome with Shawn savoring his first espresso before embarking on a caffeine-fueled adventure through Italy. As the Alfa Romeo carried him north, the team captured breathtaking moments of urban stair sets, singletrack through the Dolomites, and candid, unscripted interactions that brought the story to life.
The narrative is filled with grit and humor, from 11 espressos during a car breakdown to a hallucinatory night ride that epitomizes the playful, surreal tone of the film.

    brief: 'Yeti Cycles, a brand rooted in racing excellence, needed to balance their high-performance "Race" pillar with an equally compelling voice for their "Rip" pillar—bikes built for playful, freestyle riding. To reach this audience, we created Good Company, a film that celebrates the joy of riding with friends, where the moments off the bike are just as important as the laps themselves.',
    challengeDesc: `Yeti’s identity as a “race-bred” company is deeply ingrained, with much of their content fueled by the success of their race team. While this worked for their Race bikes, the Rip pillar needed its own unique voice—something that spoke to the core mountain biking community who ride for fun, flow, and connection rather than podium finishes. The challenge was creating content that felt authentic to this audience while standing out as distinctly "Yeti."`,
    creativeSolution: `We crafted Good Company to showcase the essence of the Rip ethos: the joy of mountain biking with friends. To capture this, we used a RED camera mounted on a backpack rig, enabling us to shoot immersive, first-person footage that brought viewers into the ride. To complement this, we handed the riders a $90 "dad cam," encouraging them to document their week with candid, unscripted moments.
The result? A mix of stunning high-quality footage and authentic, raw clips of riders laughing, joking, and sharing stories. This blend brought to life the camaraderie, shit-talking, and simple joys that define the best days on the mountain.

    brief: "When Yeti Cycles welcomed Adolf Silva, a freestyle mountain bike prodigy from Barcelona, they needed a powerful brand debut. Tasked with creating a film worthy of Adolf's talent, we crafted Dust to Dust—a freeride masterpiece filmed in the rugged terrain of Green River, Utah, designed to showcase his skills and help him cement his spot at Red Bull Rampage.",
    challengeDesc: `Adolf Silva’s arrival at Yeti Cycles presented a unique challenge: creating a standout film that not only introduced him to the brand but also amplified his chances of securing a coveted spot at Red Bull Rampage—the pinnacle event of his sport. With tight timelines, Adolf’s European schedule, and the need for terrain that matched Rampage’s intensity, the stakes couldn’t have been higher.`,
    creativeSolution: `Green River, Utah, became our stage, offering dramatic landscapes and Rampage-caliber terrain within reach of Yeti’s HQ. To prepare for Adolf’s arrival, we brought in a Yeti teammate a month early to build lines tailored to Adolf’s moto inspired tricks and riding style.
During filming, we battled unpredictable winds and shifting desert light to capture Adolf pushing the limits of freeride mountain biking. Alongside filmmaker Craig Grant, we crafted Dust to Dust—a visually stunning, adrenaline-packed introduction that earned Adolf a well-deserved spot at Red Bull Rampage that year, solidifying his place as one of the sport’s brightest stars.`,

    brief: `Espresso Forge started as a passion project in a North Carolina garage, gaining a loyal following for its hand-built, commercial-grade manual espresso machines. When new owners took over, they needed to transform the brand from a grassroots look into a luxury, boutique identity—one worthy of its premium, hand-crafted products made in the USA.`,
    challengeDesc: `While Espresso Forge had a cult following, the brand's garage-project aesthetic didn’t align with its new vision or price point. The challenge was two-fold:
    Redefine the brand’s image to reflect luxury and craftsmanship. Simplify the complex process of using the Forge to make it approachable for new customers without sacrificing its appeal to espresso enthusiasts.
`,
    creativeSolution: `We elevated the Espresso Forge brand through high-quality visuals, thoughtful design, and clear communication:
Brand Refresh: Studio shoots and café sessions captured the Forge in action, highlighting its handmade quality and blending its rugged origins with a refined, boutique feel.
Website Overhaul: A new website showcased the Forge as a luxury product, with clean, modern design and storytelling that emphasized craftsmanship, quality, and its USA-made pedigree.
Educational Media: We created step-by-step videos and intuitive product page layouts to demystify the Forge, making it easier for customers to understand and engage with the product.
The result was a seamless blend of craftsmanship and sophistication, giving Espresso Forge the premium identity needed to match its high-performance machines and premium price point.
